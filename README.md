## Specifications of the MIPS Machine: The Architecture 

MIPS Is a **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** processor. Compared with their **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)** counterparts (such as the Intel Pentium processors), RISC processors typically support fewer and much simpler instructions.

A RISC processor can be made much faster than a CISC processor because of its simpler design. RISC processors typically have a **load-store
architecture**; there are two instructions for accessing memory and none of the other instructions can access memory directly:  

- a load instruction to load data from memory, 
- a store instruction to write data to memory.
